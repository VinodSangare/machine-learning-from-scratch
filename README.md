Welcome! The goal of this repository is to provide the `implementation from scratch` of the most popular machine learning algorithms.

Now you may ask: **why should I code from scratch a Logistic Regression if I will use scikit-learn?**

Fair enough. However, I would say that it allows to `deeply understand` the algorithm you're coding, by observing with your own eyes the logic and the relative edge cases. Finally, this can be a `fun coding exercise`!

For a theoretical and illustrated overview of these algorithms, please refer to [illustrated-machine-learning.github.io](https://illustrated-machine-learning.github.io/)

At the moment you can find:
* [K-Means](kmeans/)
* [K-Nearest Neighbor](knn/)
* [Naive Bayes Classifier](naive-bayes/)
* [Logistic Regression](logistic-regression/)
* [Linear Regression](linear-regression/)

To be done:
* Support Vector Machine
* Multi-layer Perceptron
* Decision Tree
